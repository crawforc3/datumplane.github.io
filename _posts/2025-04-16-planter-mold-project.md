I decided to design and 3D print a mold to create biodegradable planters from paper pulp. The goal is to blend cardboard/paper and water, pack it into the mold, let it dry, and have a pot that can be planted directly into the ground.

**V1 Design and Attempt:**

I started designing the mold in Onshape.

Here's the initial CAD model (V1):

Printing the V1 mold parts:

Preparing the paper pulp:

The first attempt using V1:

> **Dark Farmer — 3/29/25, 10:03 AM**
> One hour was not enough time. Gonna leave it for a random amount of hours and maybe put it in the oven at some point
>
> **Dark Farmer — 3/29/25, 10:53 AM**
> Maybe I can put it in a container with a heat mat

> **Dark Farmer — 3/29/25, 6:15 PM**
> It's still sitting in the container with a heat mat

> **Dark Farmer — 3/30/25, 7:27 AM**
> Cardboard pot was unsuccessful. Still too wet. Crumbled right away.
> [7:28 AM]
> I'm going to blend it up again and try one more time
> [7:29 AM]
> The paste is a bit chunky so maybe a finer paste will help
>
> **Dark Farmer — 3/30/25, 7:48 AM**
> Oh shit the center part of the mold is full of water haha
> [7:53 AM]
> The paste doesn't go all the way up the sides either. I might flip the model so the pot mold is upside down and I can pack it in around the sides
>
> **nips — 3/30/25, 7:58 AM**
> I feel like it's never going to dry how you need it to if it's trapped in that mold
>
> **Dark Farmer — 3/30/25, 7:59 AM**
> Yeah same
> I was able to get a solid bottom part out no problem. If I can make that happen for the sides then I think I'll be able to get it out and dry the rest of it
>
> **Chief — 3/30/25, 7:59 AM**
> Needs to be some sort of drain
>
> **Dark Farmer — 3/30/25, 8:00 AM**
> The bottom cap is loose, water drains out no problem
>
> **Chief — 3/30/25, 8:00 AM**
> Feels like there needs to be ventilation
> [8:01 AM]
> In the middle
>
> **Dark Farmer — 3/30/25, 8:01 AM**
> Yeah
> [8:02 AM]
> I might add some flour for binding too
> [8:04 AM]
> I just need it to hold together when I pull it out

**V2 Design and Drying Box:**

Time for a redesign (V2):

> **Dark Farmer — 3/30/25, 8:28 AM**
> Made some modifications
> [8:29 AM]
> Now the top cap is the bottom cap The shell is the same, but I'll be able to pack the paste in around the mold

<div style="text-align: center;">

> **Dark Farmer — 3/30/25, 8:53 AM**
> Rounded off the bottom

Assembling and filling V2:

> **Dark Farmer — 3/30/25, 5:12 PM**
> V2 in progress
> [5:13 PM]
> I didn't squeeze the paste this time. Super watery. But I was able to pack it in around the sides
> [5:15 PM]
> Clamped it down to squeeze it, then set it in top of the heating mat

Initial drying stages for V2:

> **Dark Farmer — 3/31/25, 10:10 AM**
> Removed bottom cap this morning. It's still wet but I have it upside down with the cap off and the mold is sitting directly on the heating mat

<div style="text-align: center;">

</div>

> **Dark Farmer — 3/31/25, 2:53 PM**
> I got the shell off

<div style="text-align: center;">
<img src="/blog/assets/images/plantermold/18.jpg" alt="V2 with shell removed, pulp is formed and holdingh shape, still very wet." height="400">
</div>

To speed up drying, I built a drying box:

> **Dark Farmer — 3/31/25, 10:11 AM**
> I'm considering making a sleeve out of tpu that I could attach to a fan. And sorta create a negative vacuum and maybe evaporated water faster
>
> **Dark Farmer — 3/31/25, 1:54 PM**
> Actually... I wonder if I could just cut a square into the bottom cap and mount a pc fan
> [1:55 PM]
> I don't have a spare fan
>
> **Dark Farmer — 3/31/25, 3:34 PM**
> "Found" one

> Cut a hole on top and mounted the fan so it can pull humid air out

**V2 Drying and Demolding:**

The drying box seemed to help.

> **Dark Farmer — 4/1/25, 2:09 PM**
> Hell yeah way drier

<div style="text-align: center;">
<img src="/blog/assets/images/plantermold/23.jpg" alt="V2 cast looking good, much drier" height="400">
</div>

> **Dark Farmer — 4/1/25, 2:38 PM**
> I don't think I'm ever going to get this mold out though haha

## April 2, 2025

> **Dark Farmer — 4/2/25, 1:48 PM**
> my god the cardboard is almost dry
> I might be able to put a plant in this thing
> You can kinda see where it's dry and wet

Found a tutorial that might be useful for V3:

**Design Tools and Future Improvements:**

I used Onshape for the CAD design.

> **eightyx — 4/3/25, 8:33 AM**
> You like onshape more than fusion or did you ever use it?
>
> **Dark Farmer — 4/3/25, 10:27 AM**
> Fusion doesn't have a Linux client so I never used it
> I tried some other cad apps but I like onshape best

**Second Pot and Planting:**

Made another pot with the V2 mold.

> Hell yes

> **Dark Farmer — 4/7/25, 1:55 PM**
> Didn't get it centered very well. One side is thicc and squishy. The other side is thin and crispy
